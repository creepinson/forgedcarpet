# Forged Carpet

## About

This is a (WIP) forge 1.16+ port of the [fabric carpet mod](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet).
It currently adds a configurable tick speed setting, and a command to dynamically change it while running. 
I plan on adding a way to change piston block limits, but keep in mind that I am in school and 
that I am probably not going to port everything from this mod. However, contributions are welcome.
